# Reading

First, [download your copy of Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/about/books/Getting%20Real.pdf) and start skimming through it.  We will be referring to it often throughout the quarter.

And remember, I do not necessarily endorse everything I ask you to read - my goal is to challenge our thinking and instigate discussion.  

## Week 1 Survival Guide

This class works differently than any class you’ve ever taken before.

* Class time is for learning the big, important ideas. Homework time is for learning the details. 
* DO NOT furiously take notes while I'm speaking.  Trust me on this.  Listen actively and just try to understand the big idea. Take notes for details during the lab times instead.
* When I’m demonstrating something, your only job is to focus so that you can ask a question.
* The code that I write in class is always available online for study and review.
* You *will* need to look up more details online. I will provide some helpful links on the course website, but there’s a thing now called Google.

## Secrets of the Ninjas

- Be curious about everything.
- Always look for cause and effect. There is a reason for everything.
- Read error messages.
- Got code that works, but not sure why? Intentionally break the code, and see what changes.
- When you Google: try to use specific, uncommon words; or, paste an entire error message.
- Read error messages.
- Wikipedia is actually very reliable for technical topics.  Use it!
- Just Try It. You will learn more by experimenting than by thinking or searching or reading. 
- Write as much code as you can. Make up tiny problems for yourself and try to solve them.
- Read error messages.
