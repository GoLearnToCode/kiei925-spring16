Please read all of these this week.  Be ready to discuss in class.

Remember: I do not necessarily endorse everything here - the idea is to challenge your thinking.

# Week 1 Survival Guide

This class works differently than any class you’ve ever taken before.

If you want to succeed, you will also need to work differently than you ever have before.

* Class time is for learning the big, important ideas. 
* Homework time is for learning the details. 
* DO NOT take notes while I'm talking or coding.  Trust me on this.  Take notes during the lab times instead.
* When I’m demonstrating something, your only job is to focus so that you can ask a question.
* The code that I write in class is always available online for study and review.
* You are free to jot down extra notes during the labs, during break times, and after class.
* You *will* need to look up more details online. I will provide some helpful links on the course website, but there’s a thing now called Google.
* Use the Aha! Board to your advantage, every day.


**Consider The Following**

Professional developers make their money by knowing how to invent unique solutions through research, not by memorizing past solutions.
They have learned how to think. Not how to copy.

Even if you don't aspire to become a professional developer, you will work for companies that create digital products.
This course is will help, you can't learn everything in just 10 weeks.  

Knowing all of this, consider the following:

__What should you learn now, so that you can continue to learn more on your own?__

## Secrets of the Ninjas

✤ When you Google: try to use specific, uncommon words; or, paste an entire error message. ✤ Filter results to only the past year or shorter (click Search Tools on the right side).
✤ You can trust answers from rubyonrails.org, ruby-lang.org, and stackoverflow.com.
✤ Read error messages.
✤ Watch out for singular vs. plural words: movie vs. movies, user vs. users, etc.
✤ Make sure that blog or tutorial you’re reading is for Rails 4+ and Ruby 2+
✤ Don’t believe online tutorials (using code generators, etc.) until after this course.
✤ Just Try ItTM. You will learn more by experimenting than by thinking or searching or reading. ✤ Write as much code as you can. Make up tiny problems for yourself and try to solve them. ✤ Watch your Rails server log.
✤ Read error messages.
✤ Always look for cause and effect. There is a reason for everything.
✤ Got code that works but not sure why? Intentionally break the code, and see what changes. ✤ Be curious about everything.
✤ Stuck for more than five minutes? Ask the ducky!
✤ What’s fuzzy? What’s crystal-clear?
✤ Read error messages.
