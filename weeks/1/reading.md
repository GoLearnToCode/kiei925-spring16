# Reading

First, [download your copy of Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/about/books/Getting%20Real.pdf) and start skimming through it.  We will be referring to it often throughout the quarter.

And remember, I do not necessarily endorse everything I ask you to read - my goal is to challenge our thinking and instigate discussion.  

## Week 1 Survival Guide

This class works differently than any class you’ve ever taken before.

If you want to succeed, you will also need to work differently than you ever have before.

* Class time is for learning the big, important ideas. 
* Homework time is for learning the details. 
* DO NOT furiously take notes while I'm speaking.  Trust me on this.  Listen actively and just try to understand the big idea. Take notes for details during the lab times instead.
* When I’m demonstrating something, your only job is to focus so that you can ask a question.
* The code that I write in class is always available online for study and review.
* You are free to jot down extra notes during the labs, during break times, and after class.
* You *will* need to look up more details online. I will provide some helpful links on the course website, but there’s a thing now called Google.


**Consider The Following**

Professional developers make their money by knowing how to invent unique solutions through research, not by memorizing past solutions. They have learned how to think. Not how to copy.   

_What should you learn now, so that you can continue to learn more on your own?_

## Secrets of the Ninjas

- Be curious about everything.
- Always look for cause and effect. There is a reason for everything.
- Read error messages.
- Got code that works, but not sure why? Intentionally break the code, and see what changes.
- When you Google: try to use specific, uncommon words; or, paste an entire error message.
- Filter results to only the past year or shorter (click Search Tools on the right side).
- You can trust answers from rubyonrails.org, ruby-lang.org, and stackoverflow.com.
- Read error messages.
- Watch out for singular vs. plural words: movie vs. movies, user vs. users, etc.
- Make sure that blog or tutorial you’re reading is for Rails 4+ and Ruby 2+
- Don’t believe online tutorials (using code generators, etc.) until after this course.
- Just Try It. You will learn more by experimenting than by thinking or searching or reading. 
- Write as much code as you can. Make up tiny problems for yourself and try to solve them.
- Watch your Rails server log.
- Stuck for more than five minutes? Ask the ducky!
- What’s fuzzy? What’s crystal-clear?
- Read error messages.
