**Here's the plan for today.**

* What in the world are we doing here?
* What is an MVP? (No, I don't mean Patrick Kane or Kris Bryant)
* Become familiar with the value of low-fidelity wireframes
* Get familiar with Cloud9
* Create your first web page in Ruby on Rails

If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:

* Draw a basic wireframe
* Create static HTML pages inside of a live web application
* Realize that everything Jeff says is probably a movie reference or a lame pun/joke

**Links From Today:**

* The code we wrote in class is available on GitHub: https://github.com/kiei925-spring16/week1
* We didn't talk about it, but there are many free webfonts available at [FontSquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) and [Adobe Edge](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/).
