**Here's the plan for today.**

* What in the world are we doing here?
* What is an MVP? (No, not Patrick Kane or Kris Bryant)
* Learn the recipe for writing a proper _user story_
* Get familiar with Cloud9
* Create your first web page in Ruby on Rails

If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:

* Start your domain modeling
* Create static HTML pages inside of a live web application
* Realize that almost everything Jeff says is a movie reference or a lame pun/joke
