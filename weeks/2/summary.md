**Here's the plan for today**.

* Understand the basics of the Ruby programming language: variables and loops
* Understand the relationship between HTML, Ruby, and the Rails web framework
* Use Ruby to consume data exposed by public APIs
* Use Ruby to make a _dynamic_ website instead of a static website
* Know where all of the generated HTML is coming from


If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:

* Add the Bootstrap framework to your application
* Add programming logic into your web pages by embedding Ruby code into your HTML
