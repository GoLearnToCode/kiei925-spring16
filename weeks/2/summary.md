**Here's the plan for today**.

* Understand the basics of the Ruby programming language: variables and loops
* Understand the relationship between HTML, Ruby, and the Rails web framework
* Use Ruby to make a _dynamic_ website instead of a static website
* Know where all of the generated HTML is coming from
* Use Ruby to consume JSON data exposed by public APIs
* Add Ruby to your logic to your controller class
* Use the `params` hash to make use of querystring parameters in the address bar


*If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:*

* Use Ruby to keep maintain of a data list
* Add programming logic into your web pages by embedding Ruby code into your HTML
* Have one URL redirect to another URL
