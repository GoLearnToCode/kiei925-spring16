# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Tuesday, June 7, 6:30pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a workspace in your C9 account. Please send an email to Garrett when your project is ready for review; include the name of your final project workspace and your live URL (if applicable).

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

1. Each requirement listed below is worth up to 4 points. You may choose up to 5 requirements, for a total of 20 points.
2. Up to another 5 points can be awarded based on the instructor's subjective evaluation, based on code readability and overall execution, which includes usability, visual styling, adhering to best practices in modern software development (e.g. DRY) by eliminating duplicate code in your application through the use of view partials and before_actions.

### Requirements Menu

Pick any 5.  Each item is worth up to 4 points.

- Provide wireframes, user stories, and business rules for your entire application.
- Implement at least three models, with declarative associations (i.e. has_many, belongs_to), and at least one many-to-many association. 
- Using resource-based routing (i.e. the golden seven), implement at least three resources.
- Authentication and authorization. Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Protect sensitive parts of your application through the use of a before_action. Implement role-based authorization and support at least two different types of users to access different parts of your application.
- Proper use of a CSS framework like Bootstrap (grid usage, form elements, or other components). Use Bootstrap alerts to inform users of state changes (e.g. successful log-in, database record creation).
- Populate the database via CSV import or load data from an external web service using RubyGems.Note: Using the APIs we've used in class (Forecast.io, Spotify, OMDB) does not qualify unless it is materially enhances your project.
- Write a persuasive 2-page paper related to startup management.  Ideas: agile vs waterfall project management; how this course has affected your understanding of building apps;  technology risks/pitfalls in early stage startups; etc.
- Deploy your app to Heroku. If working in a group, only one live deployment is required. Include your URL in your submission (i.e. your email to Garrett) for full credit.
